    OBJECTIVES
    --------------------------------------------
    
    - Define a promise
        A promise is an object that represents a task that will be completed
        in the future
        Analogy: Taking an number at a government office before you can get
        helped. The piece of paper you get is like your promise. The help you
        get at the counter is like the invocation of your callback.
        
    - Add a .then callback to a promise
        resolve promise - successfully invocated
    
    - Add a .catch callback to a promise
        reject promise - error handling invocated
    
    - Wrap a setTimeout call in a promise
