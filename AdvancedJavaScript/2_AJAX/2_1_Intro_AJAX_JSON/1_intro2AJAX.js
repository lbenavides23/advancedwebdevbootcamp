    Introduction to AJAX
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    AJAX abbrev. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

    AJAX is NOT
        1) A Library
        2) A Framework
        3) A Technology
        
    AJAX is... an approach (that's it) !!!!
        It uses existing technologies
         1) HTML
         2) CSS
         3) The DOM
         4) JavaScript
         5) XMLHTTP Requests

    What it boils down to ----> With AJAX, websites can send and request data
    from a server in the background without disturbing the current page
    ********** Today's Single Page Apps ******************
    
    JavaScript - The user scrolled to the bottom. Then, quickly send a request
    server  and get more content! Now, I'll just append the new data to the
    bottom of the page
    
    Present 2018 -- >Making Requests with JavaScript
    ---------------------------------------
        = XMLHTTP Request
        = The Fetch API
        = 3rd Party Libraries: JQuery, Axios, etc.
        
    XML and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) ---> Data formats
    ------------------------------
    JSON - looks almost exactly like JavaScript objects
    JSON is more commonly used these days because it works so well with JavaScript
